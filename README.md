# Project-Ancient-Texts-Decoder
I've created a modular system for ancient text decoding with the following key components:
1.	Image Processing (src/services/imageProcessing/)
•	Preprocessing for noise reduction and contrast enhancement
•	Handles initial image cleanup and normalization
2.	Text Detection (src/services/textDetection/)
•	Segmentation algorithms for identifying text regions
•	Connected components analysis
•	Region filtering and classification
3.	Text Recognition (src/services/textRecognition/)
•	Character recognition using deep learning
•	Context analysis for improved accuracy
•	Language model integration
4.	Type Definitions (src/types/)
•	Clear interfaces for all data structures
•	Strong typing for better code reliability
•	Comprehensive metadata support
5.	Utility Functions (src/utils/)
•	Model loading and validation
•	Image processing helpers
•	Orientation detection
Key Features:
1.	Modular Architecture
•	Each component has a single responsibility
•	Easy to test and maintain
•	Flexible for future improvements
2.	Strong Typing
•	TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
•	Clear contract between components
•	Better error detection
3.	Advanced Processing
•	Multi-stage text detection
•	Context-aware recognition
•	Support for damaged text reconstruction
4.	Error Handling
•	Confidence scores for results
•	Alternative interpretations
•	Validation at each step
This structure allows for:
•	Easy integration of new AI models
•	Flexible processing pipeline
•	Clear separation of concerns
•	Maintainable and testable code
The system can be extended with additional features like:
•	Support for different ancient languages
•	Custom AI model training
•	Advanced damage detection
•	Multi-script recognition
