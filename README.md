# Project-Ancient-Texts-Decoder
I've set up the initial structure for the Ancient Texts Decoder SaaS platform. Here's what's included:

Core Features:
3D viewer using React Three Fiber for artifact visualization
State management with Zustand
API integration with React Query
Type-safe development with TypeScript
Routing with React Router
Styling with Tailwind CSS
Key Components:
ThreeDViewer: Main 3D visualization component
ArtifactModel: Handles 3D model rendering
Artifact store: Manages application state
Custom hooks for data fetching
Type Definitions:
Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for artifacts and settings
Strict type checking for better development experience
The development server is now running. This is the foundation for the platform, and we can now proceed to implement specific features like:

Ink refinement tools
Segmentation algorithms
Documentation system
Volume cartographer tools
Compression analysis features
